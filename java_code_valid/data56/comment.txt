Find the instance of a given class type that is closest to a given instance. This method uses the getParent method VAR0 the Tag interface. This method is used for coordination among cooperating tags. <p> The current version of the specification only provides one formal way of indicating the observable type of a tag handler: its tag handler implementation class, described in the tag-class subelement of the tag element.  This is extended in an informal manner by allowing the tag library author to indicate in the description subelement an observable type. The type should be a subtype of the tag handler implementation class or void. This additional constraint can be exploited by a specialized container that knows about that specific tag library, as in the case of the JSP standard tag library. <p> When a tag library author provides information on the observable type of a tag handler, client programmatic code should adhere to that constraint.  Specifically, the Class passed to findAncestorWithClass should be a subtype of the observable type.
