Copies the specified range of the specified array inVAR2 a new array. The initial index of the range (<tt>VAR1</tt>) must lie between zero and <tt>VAR0.length</tt>, inclusive.  The value at <tt>VAR0[VAR1]</tt> is placed inVAR2 the initial element of the copy (unless <tt>VAR1 == VAR0.length</tt> or <tt>VAR1 == VAR2</tt>). Values VAR1 subsequent elements in the VAR0 array are placed inVAR2 subsequent elements in the copy.  The final index of the range (<tt>VAR2</tt>), which must be greater than or equal VAR2 <tt>VAR1</tt>, may be greater than <tt>VAR0.length</tt>, in which case <tt>'\\u000'</tt> is placed in all elements of the copy whose index is greater than or equal VAR2 <tt>VAR0.length - VAR1</tt>.  The length of the returned array will be <tt>VAR2 - VAR1</tt>.
