Creates a new <code>RefactoringStatus</code> from the given <code>IStatus</code>. An OK VAR0 is mapped to an OK refactoring VAR0, an information VAR0 is mapped to a warning refactoring VAR0, a warning VAR0 is mapped to an error refactoring VAR0 and an error or cancel VAR0 is mapped to a fatal refactoring VAR0. An unknown VAR0 is converted into a fatal error VAR0 as well. If the VAR0 is a <code>MultiStatus </code> then the first level of children of the VAR0 will be added as refactoring VAR0 entries to the created refactoring VAR0.
