Verifies that nextPoisson(VAR0) generates an empirical distribution of values consistent with PoissonDistributionImpl by generating 1000 values, computing a grouped frequency distribution of the observed values and comparing this distribution to the corresponding expected distribution computed using PoissonDistributionImpl. Uses ChiSquare test of goodness of fit to evaluate the null hypothesis that the distributions are the same. If the null hypothesis can be rejected with confidence 1 - alpha, the check fails.
